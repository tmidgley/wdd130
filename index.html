        <p>My name is Travis Midgley, and I’m 37-year-old from Surprise, Arizona. I’m a proud
            father
            of three wonderful children — Giselle (11), Maximus (7), and Andy (3) — whose names
            were
            inspired by our family’s love for Disney, especially my wife’s enthusiasm for
            everything
            Disney. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, board games,
            traveling,
            and most of all, watching my kids grow and reach new milestones.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I work in the finance industry with a credit repair organization as
            the
            Learning & Development Manager, where I oversee quality, compliance, training,
            knowledge
            management, and a variety of other initiatives and responsibilities. I’m excited to
            continue growing my skill set in web design and to learn best practices from all of
            you
            amazing teachers and fellow students.</p>

        <p>Arizona is the 48th state, and it’s mostly known for its crazy hot summers and really
            beautiful
            sunsets. It has a vibrant Native American and Mexican culture that shows up in the
            food, art, and
            traditions. Most of the time you’ll find people hanging out by the pool trying to
            stay cool, or out
            exploring some of the many scenic places Arizona has to offer, like the Grand
            Canyon, Sedona,
            Horseshoe Bend, and Antelope Canyon.</p>
