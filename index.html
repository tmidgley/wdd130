        <p>My name is Travis Midgley, and I’m 37-year-old from Surprise, Arizona. I’m a proud father
            of three wonderful children — Giselle (11), Maximus (7), and Andy (3) — whose names were
            inspired by our family’s love for Disney, especially my wife’s enthusiasm for everything
            Disney. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, board games, traveling,
            and most of all, watching my kids grow and reach new milestones.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I work in the finance industry with a credit repair organization as the
            Learning & Development Manager, where I oversee quality, compliance, training, knowledge
            management, and a variety of other initiatives and responsibilities. I’m excited to
            continue growing my skill set in web design and to learn best practices from all of you
            amazing teachers and fellow students.</p>
